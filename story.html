        This section will go through what I have done throughout my whole life
        from being born to now. So what am I waiting for, A STORY, that may be
        extremely long, BUT IS WORTH READING.

        I was born in New York and moved to New Jersey when I was three. A year
        later, I had pneumonia but this turned into something else. The doctors
        found a tumor and this was the start of life in a hospital. The tumor
        was the evolution of Ewing sarcoma and I needed treatment every day I
        was there (Realize I don't remember much from when I had cancer). It may
        have seemed that I would not be here right now but that was a different
        story. I was lucky that the tumor was found early so they were able to
        treat it quicker. I also had no form of entertainment until someone
        gifted me a DS. I was so busy playing Mario Kart that I would not know
        anything that happened. Shots, THEY ARE NOTHING. I stayed occupied every
        single day. Certain times I would see dogs come into the room and the
        "guitar guy". After a year of being in the hospital, I was cured from
        cancer.
      </p>
      <p id="prevent">
        As of October 20, 2011 to today, I AM OFFICIALLY 10 YEARS OUT OF CANCER.
      </p>

      <p id="prevent">
        From there, I succeeded in school and started moving on with life. I
        started to play sports, especially baseball.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Life Playing Baseball</h2>
      <br />
      <p id="prevent">
        I wanted to start playing a sport and I decided to choose baseball. I
        first started playing in tee ball with a recreational league. Before I
        got my first ever at bat, I TRIP ON MY COACH'S GLOVE. WHAT A START! I
        continued on with the recreational league, into coach pitch, and
        starting child pitch. Though I wanted to go a little further. It was
        time I started to play on a travel team with me starting on the Marlboro
        Mustangs. Was the team good? Nope. There are three moments I remember
        and I will start with the one positive result. One of my greatest hits
        on the Mustangs was a blasted ball into the gap of left and centerfield.
        This caused the runner from second to go home and for me to get my first
        ever double. It was an amazing memory as I was the smallest player. Now
        for the two negatives from this time. At the time, my body was not fully
        grown and it was definitely weak. I got a pitch right towards my legs
        and since I did not get out of the way in time, I got hit. Right in the
        knee cap and I was limping for around two weeks. On to the other
        negative. Eventually I would leave this team due to the excessive "daddy
        ball" gameplay. Arguments broke out and my dad decided it was time to
        leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next team was Bullpen and I had one good coach and one bad coach.
        The good coach would always have us play whiffleball at times, make the
        practices fun, and all other things. The bad coach though, took away the
        whiffleball. He also made me play twice in one day. One for my normal
        team and one for the younger team. Eventually the umpires would realize
        what he did and they would see that I am way older and I have an
        advantage over the others. My parents did not like it and eventually he
        got fired but I did meet a ton of other coaches that were amazing.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a bit of time. It seemed like my team has disbanded right out of
        thin air. Only three of my teammates have followed me at this point. I
        would joined the Old Bridge Blue Claws and this team was interesting in
        ways but it was fun while it lasted. Another one of my main memories
        came from this team. I was playing in rightfield, two outs, bases loaded
        and the pressure was on as the score was tied or very close. The batter
        slammed a line drive going towards my area. It was on my throwing hand
        side so I would have to backhand a flyball in order to catch it. It was
        also moving much faster as I was running in the direction it was going.
        The only way I were to catch it is if I were to dive. I dove and as I
        saw the ball travel into my glove, I rolled on the ground to see that it
        stuck inside and I saved my team from what could have been a huge
        disaster. I even have a game ball for it. We would later on win this
        game and even though I didn't win championships with this team. They
        were much better than the previous two.
      </p>

      <p>
        My last team and current team I'm on today. The Old Bridge Lightning. My
        three teammates that follwed me into the Old Bridge Blue Claws, would
        eventually follow me into the Lightning. This team was better than ever
        as one coach would leave and we would get another coach but they were
        all amazing. Our team must have one at least two championships and the
        team would ultimately be in at least four finals gaining second place.
        This team even plays up a level. We used to be ranked three out of five.
        That would go up to a 3.5 and our team would still go up against a very
        competitive level. In the first round where my team was losing and
        seemed like we were going out early, I place the perfect hit. All I did
        was hit a blooper in the middle of the infield behind the pitcher's
        mound. No one caught it and I was able to use my speed and be safe at
        first to keep the series going. We won the first round, won the second
        and we were on to the championship where my team would go up against the
        other hardest team in our specific league. Sadly, my team lost but it
        was amazing to see how far we were able to go.
      </p>

      <p>
        During freshman year of high school, I went to the tryouts for baseball
        and lucky for me, I made it on due to shortage of players. Most of the
        time this is bad but our team was better than someone would think. Most
        of the games we lost were always one or two runs off from a tied game
        and our record was six wins and nine losses. If this team were to keep
        the lead for most of these games, our record would be swapped. My best
        hit during this season was a line drive right over the second baseman's
        head for a single. My team was not close to winning that game but it
        felt good to get a hit.

      <h2>Dog Life</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        My dad really wanted a dog but we were sticking with fish for a while
        and two of them are somehow still alive today. We went to PetSmart for
        fish food but while we were there, people were adopting dogs. My younger
        mind decided to go up to the cage and pet the dogs. Immediately, I had a
        connection with the first dog that came up to me and that dog was Buddy.
        This was easily one of the best dogs that I could have had and everyday,
        I would play with him, sometimes feed him, and always pet him when the
        chance was given. My family could not have asked for a friendlier dog.
        One moment I remember somehow is when he ran into the backyard fence. I
        don't know how because I was probably sleeping since it was late at
        night but it was funny to hear. My parents would sometimes take him to
        baseball games and it was always fun when Buddy would act like an
        outfielder while I'm practicing or playing whiffleball. After four years
        of having him, sadly he had cancer and when he was five and a half, he
        had a stroke right at the end of all of his treatment. It was
        heartbreaking. But there was something in me and my parents showing that
        we are still determined to get a dog.
      </p>

      <p>
        We forced another attempt for a dog and this should not have been the
        plan. We got a dog named Hunter but I though, name him Simba because why
        not. It's a cool name. As soon as we had him in the car, he was licking
        me nonstop. Anytime either my dad or I would grab a toy and play with
        him, he would immediately bite our hand for no reason at all. The
        specific breed he was is the full reason why he would go after our
        fingers or toes. We even had another family come to our house to help us
        with this dog and no matter what they did, this dog rebeled against all
        of us. He just was not the right fit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quick note: this dog life story ends here unless we get our neighbor's
        dog which that will be another addition to this long story.
      </p>

      <p>More could definitely be added</p>
