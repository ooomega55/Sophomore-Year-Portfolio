        Hello, my name is George Fischetti. I have been learning web design
        since September of 2021. I am hardworking, kind, and trustworthy to
        others. I have been working on separate single paged websites and this
        is the first multiple paged website. There are no special effects yet
        but that will for sure change in the future.

        I was first introduced into web designing during the 2020 to 2021 school
        year when I chose digital media one as an elective. From there I met
        Mrs. Leonard on the computer for the full school year and I was
        suggested to take this course. This changes everything completely since
        I never thought anything about a job for the future and this will guide
        me towards my decision.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time I like to play sports, especially baseball and table
        tennis. I also play golf for fun mostly with my dad though I have been
        focusing on improving my hitting skills in baseball. I play for the Old
        Bridge Lightning on a travel team and we have made it to the
        championship multiple times and won in 2019. Even with some extra down
        time, I like to play videogames. These include Minecraft, Rocket League,
        certain Mario games, and Pokemon Legends Arceus.

        Some extra information about me. As individuals may see, my favorite
        color is specifically lime or cyan. My height is five foot two and I am
        expecting to get taller. Scroll down to see some projects.
